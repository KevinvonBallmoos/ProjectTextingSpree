# ProjectTextingSpree
Welcome to 3 Trolls Games, an unofficial indie game studio based in Switzerland! We are a small team of three passionate gamers who grew up playing
on the Super Nintendo console and have been hooked ever since. We share a common frustration with the current state of the game industry and its focus
on quantity over quality, and we believe that games should be about more than just flashy graphics and mindless action.

That's why we've been working hard on our latest project for over six months now: a text-based adventure game with a rich, immersive story, compelling characters,
and plenty of surprises along the way. Our goal is to create a game that captures the essence of the classic RPGs we grew up with, but with a fresh and modern twist.
We believe that a good game is more than just entertainment; it's an experience that can transport you to another world and leave a lasting impression.

We're excited to share our vision with you and invite you to join us on this journey. Whether you're a fellow gamer, a fan of interactive storytelling,
or just curious about what we're up to, we hope you'll enjoy playing our game as much as we've enjoyed creating it. So, without further ado, let's get started on this adventure together!

# Our team
As already mentioned, we are a small indie game development team, consisting of three passionate and creative individuals who are dedicated to creating engaging and immersive
gaming experiences. Our team is led by Kastriot Dulla, who serves as both our game director and developer, bringing technical expertise and creative vision to our project.
Alongside Kastriot, we have Kevin von Ballmoos, our lead game designer and programmer, who is responsible for crafting the gameplay mechanics and user interface.
Finally, Frederic Baerfuss, our lead story and narrative designer, brings our games to life with rich and captivating storylines that keep players invested from start to finish. Together,
we are committed to making games that stand out from the crowd and offer something truly unique for gamers to enjoy.
