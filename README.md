# Tales of Rydonia: The legacy of the gifted
Welcome to 3 Trolls Games, an unofficial indie game studio based in Switzerland! We are a small team of three passionate gamers who grew up playing
on the Super Nintendo console and have been hooked ever since. We share a common frustration with the current state of the game industry and its focus
on quantity over quality, and we believe that games should be about more than just flashy graphics and mindless action.

That's why we've been working hard on our latest project for over six months now: a text-based adventure game with a rich, immersive story, compelling characters,
and plenty of surprises along the way. Our goal is to create a game that captures the essence of the classic RPGs we grew up with, but with a fresh and modern twist.
We believe that a good game is more than just entertainment; it's an experience that can transport you to another world and leave a lasting impression.

We're excited to share our vision with you and invite you to join us on this journey. Whether you're a fellow gamer, a fan of interactive storytelling,
or just curious about what we're up to, we hope you'll enjoy playing our game as much as we've enjoyed creating it. So, without further ado, let's get started on this adventure together!

# Our team
As already mentioned, we are a small indie game development team, consisting of three passionate and creative individuals who are dedicated to creating engaging and immersive
gaming experiences. Our team is led by Kastriot Dulla, who serves as both our game director and developer, bringing technical expertise and creative vision to our project.
Alongside Kastriot, we have Kevin von Ballmoos, our lead game designer and programmer, who is responsible for crafting the gameplay mechanics and user interface.
Finally, Frederic Baerfuss, our lead story and narrative designer, brings our games to life with rich and captivating storylines that keep players invested from start to finish. Together,
we are committed to making games that stand out from the crowd and offer something truly unique for gamers to enjoy.

# Project structure
Here we are going to look at how our project has been structured and we will be looking into the different aspects of the game itself. Following things are going to be
looked into in more detail:

- Story and Narrative
- Gameplay Mechanics
- Art and Design
- Technology

Last but not least, we will be looking into where to find specific documents that will be helpful if you are part of the team and have any questions you need aswered.

**Story and Narrative**

The game takes place on the fictional planet of Eryndor and on the continent of Regalos, where five nations are in constant struggle with each other for resources and power.
The player enters the story at a critical moment, three years after the militaristic Rydonian Empire has occupied the small and isolated nation of Thamaria. As a "gifted", a human
with demigod blood in their veins, the player has unique abilities to conjure magic, thanks to the blood of the gods they inherited.

After being discovered and captured, the player is sent to the Obsidian Tower, a special prison for gifted individuals. Here they meet Cecilia, a mysterious and
beautiful woman who also possesses unique abilities. Together, they make a daring escape and begin a journey to leave the capital of the Rydonian Empire, Ostia.

Throughout the game, the player will encounter political intrigue, internal struggles, and complex characters, some of which might want to help or hinder their journey,
as they navigate the conflicts between the five nations. The story is designed to be rich and immersive, with plenty of twists and turns to keep the player engaged.
Ultimately, the player's choices and actions will determine the outcome of the story and the fate of not only the Rydonian Empire and Thamaria, but all of Regalos.

**Gameplay Mechanics**

The gameplay in our text-based adventure game is centered around immersive storytelling and decision-making. As players read through the story, they will be presented
with choices that have a significant impact on the outcome of the game. Each decision comes with its own set of consequences, some of which are small and inconsequential,
while others are major and can alter the course of the game.

Throughout the game, players will be shown pictures of characters and surroundings, accompanied by a dynamic soundtrack and ambient sound effects. The game's soundscape
will help immerse players in the game world and enhance their experience of the story.

In addition to the choices they make, players will also have an inventory where they can collect and manage items they find during the game. These items may be helpful
in completing quests or unlocking different parts of the story. However, some items can have unintended consequences, so players must choose wisely when deciding what
to keep and what to discard.

Additionally, the game will feature a map to help the player navigate the world or a larger city. This feature will aid in orienting the player and allowing them to
explore the game world more freely.

Overall, our game's mechanics are designed to provide players with a captivating and immersive experience that puts them in control of the story's outcome.
We hope players enjoy exploring the game world, making choices, and experiencing the story's twists and turns.

**Art and Design**

The game's art style is centered around charcoal drawings, providing a unique visual experience for the player. We utilize cutting-edge AI technology
like the "Midjourney AI" to generate many of the game's visuals, while others are meticulously handcrafted by our talented artist. The style is meant to give the
player a sense of being immersed in an ancient world full of myths and legends, where stories were passed down from generation to generation through word of mouth.

The user interface is designed to look like an old tome, with a greco-roman fantasy theme. The goal is to make the player feel like they are reading the personal
notes of an ancient storyteller, as they delve deeper into the rich world we've created. Every detail in the game's design, from the UI to the art, has been
carefully crafted to create a truly immersive experience.

**Technology**

The game is developed using the Unity Engine, a powerful and versatile game engine that allows for seamless development of 2D and 3D games.
We have utilized various features of the Unity Engine to create an immersive and engaging game world, including animation systems and audio and visual effects.

To generate a significant portion of the game's artwork, we used the latest AI technology called "Midjourney AI." This AI technology utilizes machine learning
algorithms to generate stunning charcoal drawings that perfectly match the game's aesthetic.

We also used other tools such as Git for version control, Jetbrains Rider for coding, and PAINT.NET for image editing.

Overall, our development process was guided by the principles of efficiency, quality, and scalability. By utilizing cutting-edge technology and best practices,
we strife to create a game that is both visually stunning and technologically advanced.

**Where to find important documents**

Many important documents can be found in the "Project Documentation" folder of the repository. After you clone the repo, navigate to the repository folder and find
the "Project Documentation" folder. Within are 3 documents of significance. The first being the project documentation, called "Tales of Rydonia - Project Documentation".
Here is the entire project, its structure and the people involved as well as many conventions listed on how we document and write things in this project.
The second document of significance would be the "Coding Conventions" describing how the project code is structured and what naming conventions and other code relevant ruels
are present withing the project as such. Last but not least there is the "Class Documentation" where every single class used in the source code is documented and how it is to be used.
